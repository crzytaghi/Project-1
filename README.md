**Quarantine Trivia**

Quarantine Trivia is a game dedicated to those who are bored, with little to do, but much to learn! You begin by selecting which category you would like to test your knowledge on or you can generate a random questionnaire

**Technologies Used**

- HTML
- CSS
- jQuery/JavaScript

**Approach Taken**

My initial approach was to create a trivia game that would simply display a set of questions for the user and he would have to answer them to his/her best knowledge. I then added some functionality that records the users input and display the score once all the questions for that category were answered, telling the user how many they get wrong vs right.

**Issues/Problems/Errors**

When pulling the data from the API, some strings of text had quot; in place of quotation marks and apostrophe's. I attempted to use .replace on the string and replace the string with the corresponding characters but was getting an error stating .replace is not a function. I had also received articles from a couple of students but did not fully understand how they managed to manipulate the data so I decided to not attempt it.

Alert message, displaying how many the user got incorrect vs correct, incorrectly counts how many clicks the user inputed when answering the questions

Spacing for random questions seems is off

Try to get the positioning of the anchor tag to stay fixed
